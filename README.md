# Usage
The main function TX_opt maximizes the system damping ratio by simultaneously adjusting generation and demand.

[success,optratio,improve,Vps1] = TX_opt(ps,Vps0,dispratio,load_level)

The function takes the inputs of transmission system data structure (ps), initial power flow solution (Vps0), percentage of controllable load (dispratio), and load level (load_level). It returns the indicator of success (success), optimized damping ratio, percentages of improvement (improve), and the power flow solution after optimization (Vps1).

See call_OptimizeRatio.m (and OptimizeRatio.m) for an example of using the function TX_opt.
